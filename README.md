### NGINX reverse proxy config

```
server {
        listen        443 ssl http2;
        server_name   phonk.live;

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        proxy_set_header Sec-WebSocket-Extensions $http_sec_websocket_extensions;
        proxy_set_header Sec-WebSocket-Key $http_sec_websocket_key;
        proxy_set_header Sec-WebSocket-Version $http_sec_websocket_version;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";

        proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

        location /socket/ {
                resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;
                set $upstream_url caster;
                proxy_pass http://$upstream_url:4000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
        location / {
                resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;
                set $upstream_url caster;
                proxy_pass http://$upstream_url:4000;
        }
}
```

### Converting MP3s to Vorbis OGG

```
  for f in **/*.mp3; do
    song_name="$(basename "$f")";
    ffmpeg -vn -i "$f" -c:a libvorbis -q:a 4 "songs/${song_name/%mp3/ogg}";
  done
```

### Creating playlist.txt from songs

```
  find songs/ > playlist.txt
```

## Things you should know:

- songs within `/etc/ices2/songs` must be `.ogg`, and they should have metadata for artist/title
- the MPEG stream is a backup, webkit devices (iOS/Mac OSX) doesn't support OGG for whatever reason, if you dont care about iOS devices you can edit `start.sh` and remove the FFMPEG relay
- with the example `docker-compose.yml` the icecast admin panel isnt exposed, therefore the ICECAST_PASSWORD does not need to be secure. You probably don't even need one, but it doesn't hurt to have

## Things I plan to do

- build up some sort of config.json for the frontend, that way with just a few config changes you can spin up any type of radio station you want! Soonâ„¢
